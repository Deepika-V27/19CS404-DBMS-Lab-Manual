# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

### Entities and Attributes

| Entity         |              Attributes (PK, FK)                          |                     Notes                |

| Member         | MemberID (PK), Name, MembershipType, StartDate            | Stores gym member details.               |
| Program        | ProgramID (PK), ProgramName, ProgramType                  | Examples: Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training.  |
| Trainer        | TrainerID (PK), Name, Specialization                      | Trainers conduct programs.               |
| Session        | SessionID (PK), Date, Time, MemberID (FK), TrainerID (FK) | Represents personal training/attendance. |
| Attendance     | AttendanceID (PK), SessionID (FK), MemberID (FK), Status  | Tracks presence of members in sessions.  |
| Payment        | PaymentID (PK), Amount, Date, MemberID (FK)               | Payments for memberships and sessions.   |

### Relationships and Constraints

| Program–Trainer             | M:N                       | Total (Program)    | A program may have multiple trainers, and a trainer can handle multiple programs. 
| Member–Trainer (Session)    | M:N via **Session**       | Partial            | Members can book personal training sessions with trainers.
